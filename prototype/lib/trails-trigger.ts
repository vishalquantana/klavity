// Plan G — the thin on-demand walk trigger. runWalkNow reserves the single walk-slot (else throws
// WalkBusyError), creates the Walk row, returns its runId to the caller IMMEDIATELY, and drives the
// actual walk in the BACKGROUND (holding the slot for the whole walk). A walk crash NEVER propagates
// to the caller / server event loop: it finalizes the run RED and releases the slot.
//
// The walk fn is INJECTABLE (deps.walk) so unit tests run with a stub (no browser); the default
// realWalk drives the Trail's own baseUrl with prod-safe Chromium + replay capture, adopting the
// pre-created runId so the run_steps / replay / verdict all land on the runId the caller holds.
// Vision (Tier-2) is OFF in realWalk; a flagged Trail (the regression demo) opts in via a custom
// deps.walk that calls walkTrail with a vision resolver.
