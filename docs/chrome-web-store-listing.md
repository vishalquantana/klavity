## Store listing

**Name (store title):** Klavity – AI Bug Reporter & Feedback for Jira, Linear, GitHub
**Short name (toolbar / chrome://extensions):** Klavity

**Summary** (132-char max — matches `manifest.json` `description`):
> AI Sims review your pages and file bug & feature tickets to Jira, Linear, GitHub, or Plane — or report any page in one click.

**Category:** Developer Tools

**Detailed description:**
> Klavity Snap turns "this is broken / this is missing" into filed, actionable tickets.
>
> • **AI Sims review your pages.** Personas built from real customer calls look at the pages you choose and react in character — flagging bugs and friction — then file what they find as tickets, complete with a screenshot and the page context.
>
> • **Analyze any page in one click.** Open the popup, hit "Analyze this page", and your Sims review the current tab — no setup, no allowlist required.
>
> • **One-click bug & feature reports.** Capture the visible page, annotate it, and file an annotated ticket straight to Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, or Plane — or to Klavity Cloud.
>
> • **You're in control.** Sims only review pages after you consent, and only on pages you allowlist or explicitly analyze. Pause anytime, or turn automatic reviews off entirely in Options.
>
> Built by Quantana. Open-core (FSL-1.1-ALv2). Privacy: https://klavity.in/privacy · Terms: https://klavity.in/terms

**Screenshots:** at least one 1280×800 or 640×400. Suggested shots: the popup (sign-in + "Analyze this page"), an in-page Sim reaction bubble, and the dashboard ticket list.

## Single purpose (required field)

> Klavity Snap captures web pages the user consents to and turns them into AI-reviewed bug and feature tickets in the user's issue tracker.

## Permission justifications (Privacy practices tab)

| Permission | Justification to paste |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Capture a screenshot of the page the user is currently on when they file a report or run "Analyze this page". |
| `storage` | Store the user's settings, sign-in session, selected project, and per-domain consent locally in the browser. |
| `scripting` | Inject Klavity's in-page reporter and Sim review overlay into the page the user is actively working on. |
| `tabs` | Read the active tab's URL so reports and reviews are attributed to the correct page and routed to that tab. |
| `cookies` | Read the Klavity session cookie on klavity.in for silent sign-in, so a user already signed in to the website doesn't re-enter a code. |
| `host_permissions: klavity.in/*` (+ `localhost`) | The extension's own backend — sign-in, config sync, AI review, and ticket filing all call the Klavity API. |
| `optional_host_permissions: *://*/*` | NOT requested at install. Granted at runtime, **per-domain**, only for the specific sites a user or their admin chooses to monitor for passive auto-review. "Analyze this page" works anywhere via `activeTab` and needs no host grant. |
| `https://*.atlassian.net/*`, `https://api.linear.app/*`, `https://api.github.com/*`, `https://api.plane.so/*` | File tickets directly from the browser to the issue tracker the user has connected (Jira, Linear, GitHub, Plane) when using direct-integration mode. |

## Data usage disclosures (certifications)

Declare that the extension **collects**:
- **Authentication information** — the user's email (for passwordless sign-in).
- **Website content** — screenshots of the visible area and structural context of pages the user consents to review/report.
- **User activity** — the specific pages the user chooses to report on or analyze.

Certify (all true for Klavity):
- ✅ Data is **not** sold or transferred to third parties outside the approved use cases (it is sent only to the LLM provider that generates the review, the user's chosen issue tracker, and Klavity's own storage — all to deliver the feature the user asked for).
- ✅ Data is **not** used or transferred for purposes unrelated to the item's single purpose.
- ✅ Data is **not** used or transferred to determine creditworthiness or for lending.

## Reviewer notes (optional "notes to reviewer" field)

> Klavity does NOT request broad host access. Click-driven actions ("Analyze this page",
> Report) run on the current tab via `activeTab`. Passive auto-review runs only on the specific
> domains a user or their admin whitelists and grants once at runtime (optional host permissions,
> requested per-domain from the popup) — registered dynamically and gated to the active/foreground
> tab. All capture is consent-gated (a per-site confirm before the first screenshot); screenshots
> are stored privately and expire after 30 days; automatic review can be disabled entirely in Options.

## Packaging reminder

Upload artifact is built from `packages/extension/dist` (the zip's root must contain
`manifest.json`). Rebuild + re-zip after any change:

```bash
cd packages/extension && npm run build
cd dist && zip -rq ../../../klavity-snap-<version>.zip .
```

The Chrome Web Store rejects an upload whose `manifest.json` `version` is **not higher** than the
currently published version — bump the version (lockstep across all manifests + PRD + CHANGELOG)
before re-uploading an already-published item.
